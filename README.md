# Voice Cloning Project with Whisper STT and Coqui TTS
Building a customized voice cloning model
This project aims to demonstrate the process of voice cloning using the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system and the Coqui TTS (Text-to-Speech) engine. By combining these two powerful tools, we can create a system that converts written text into synthesized speech, mimicking a specific target speaker.


## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following components installed and configured:

1. Python 3: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Whisper STT: Install the Whisper ASR system by following the instructions in its official repository: https://github.com/openai/whisper.
3. Coqui TTS: Install the Coqui TTS engine by referring to its official documentation: https://coqui.ai/.
